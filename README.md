# Surfs_Up

## A weather analysis reviewing patterns in Hawaii opening a shop

## Overview of the Project

This analysis utilizes tools for data storage and analysis to find trends in Oahu, Hawaii, with summary statistics of temperature data for June and December. With this analysis, the profitiability of a year round surf and ice cream shop can be contrased to a seasonal endeavor.

## Oahu, Hawaii Temperature Patterns

* Average temperature in June is apporximately 75 degrees fahrenheit, which is a tad higher (four degrees) than the average temperature in December.
* The temperatures in June have a tighter temperature pattern (25-50-75 percentiles within 4 degrees in June compared to 5 in December). There is also a smaller std measure in June temperatures compared to December temperatures.
* December temperatures are more wider in distribution than in June.

## Summary of Findings
Despite temperatures in December varying more widely than those in June, the temperatures remain comfortable to maintain a business in the winter months for surfing and ice cream. The average temperatures of June and December only varies by four degrees. Good further analysis would come from the analysis of the temperatures by station for quality purposes. Other variables to seek whether such a business would be good in the winter is to analyze characteristics that attribute to individuals going surfing and having ice cream other than temperature, such as whether there is rain and the conditions of the wind.
